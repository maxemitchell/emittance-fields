# Ticket T-003: Field Collaboration System

### Title

Implement Field Sharing and Collaborator Management

### Priority

- [x] High

### Type

- [x] Feature

### Status

- [x] Ready

### Authorization Focus

Central authorization feature - field owners can invite collaborators with specific roles (viewer/editor), demonstrating role-based access control.

### Description

Allow field owners to invite collaborators and manage permissions:

- Add collaborators by email with role selection (viewer/editor)
- List current collaborators with role management
- Remove collaborators
- Role-based access enforcement throughout the system

### Implementation Details

- Create collaborator management UI on field details page
- Build API endpoints for collaborator CRUD operations
- Email-based user lookup for invitations
- Role selection component (viewer/editor)
- Update authorization checks across all field/emitter operations
- Show different UI based on user's role

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Field owners can add collaborators by email
- [ ] Role selection (viewer/editor) when adding collaborators
- [ ] List of current collaborators with roles visible to owner
- [ ] Ability to change collaborator roles
- [ ] Ability to remove collaborators
- [ ] Editor role allows emitter placement, viewer role is read-only
- [ ] Collaborators can access shared fields in their field list
- [ ] Cannot add the same user twice to a field

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for collaborator role validation
- [ ] Integration tests for collaborator management API
- [ ] E2E tests for complete collaboration workflow
- [ ] Authorization tests for each role's permissions

### Dependencies

- T-001 (Field Details Page)

### Estimated Effort

- [x] L (2-3 days)

### Notes

This demonstrates the sophisticated authorization system with role-based permissions and collaborative workflows.
