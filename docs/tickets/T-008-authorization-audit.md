- [ ] Role transitions handled securely (owner transfer, permission changes)
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions respect authorization
- [ ] SQL injection and other attack vectors tested
- [ ] Performance impact of authorization checks measured
- [ ] Complete security documentation written

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Comprehensive authorization test suite
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Manual penetration testing
- [ ] Performance regression tests

### Dependencies
