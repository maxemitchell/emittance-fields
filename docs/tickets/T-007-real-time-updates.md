# Ticket T-007: Real-time Collaborative Updates

### Title

Implement Real-time Updates for Collaborative Editing

### Priority

- [x] Medium

### Type

- [x] Feature

### Status

- [x] Ready

### Authorization Focus

Real-time updates must respect authorization - users only receive updates for fields they have access to, maintaining security in live collaboration.

### Description

Add real-time synchronization for collaborative field editing:

- Live updates when collaborators place/edit/delete emitters
- User presence indicators
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Real-time collaborator list updates
- Connection status and error handling

### Implementation Details

- Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Add user presence tracking
- Build conflict resolution for emitter placement
- Create real-time UI updates
- Add connection status indicators
- Handle subscription cleanup and reconnection

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time emitter updates for all collaborators
- [ ] User presence indicators showing active collaborators
- [ ] Optimistic updates with rollback on conflicts
- [ ] Real-time collaborator list updates
- [ ] Connection status visible to users
- [ ] Graceful handling of network disconnections
- [ ] Only authorized users receive field updates
- [ ] Performance optimization for high-activity fields

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for real-time event handling
- [ ] Integration tests for Supabase subscriptions
- [ ] E2E tests for multi-user collaboration scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests under high update frequency

### Dependencies

- T-002 (Emitter Placement System)
- T-003 (Field Collaboration System)

### Estimated Effort

- [x] L (2-3 days)

### Notes

Adds the collaborative real-time aspect while ensuring authorization security is maintained across live updates.
